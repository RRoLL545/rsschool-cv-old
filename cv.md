1. About me
    * _Work experience_
        * In 2004 graduated Togliatti state university as machine-building engineer. In 2010 got p.h.d in Thermical processes and metall since.
        * Since 2004 till 2011 worked as teacher in Togliatti state university
        * Since 2011 till 2018 worked at different engineer positions (process, design, logistic) in different Russian and foreign companies.
        * Since 2018 till now work as system engineer pilot for new Driveline systems development of new vehicles at AVTOVAZ
    * _Why IT?_
        * In graduate school tasks to calculate temperature and residal stresses in metall product during and after thermical process was met.
        * Tasks was done with help of known mathematical methods and Matlab. And I really liked it!
        * In same period I created gearbox development SW, using of Matlab and GUI.
        * But only in 2016 I fully recognized that I want to work in IT. Started to learn, study and so on.
    * _About my targets_
        * My main goal is to work in IT field.
        * If to be honest, I would like to work as a developer (really want to create) in big company with big projects (big projects are much more interesting than small). I also would like to use English in my job (I think, my skill is not really bad).
        * As I see EPAM is that sort of company where I can find what is described in previous point. My goal now is to pass to next training stage and at the end of the training get invitation to EPAM. And will do my best!
